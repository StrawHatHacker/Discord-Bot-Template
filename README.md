## Creating a command
A command should be a file that exports an object. Required properties of that object are:

```javascript
module.exports = {
    name: 'ban',
    description: 'Bans a user',
    aliases: ['boot'],
    syntax: 'ban <member> [reason]',
    requiredPermissions: {
        user: ['BAN_MEMBERS'],
        client: ['BAN_MEMBERS']
    },
    async run() {
        // code here
    }
}
```

`name`: Is the name of the command. It gets matched to user input.

`description`: General information about the command.

`aliases`: Array of strings that can invoke the command. They get matched to user input.

`syntax`: Visual representation of how the command should be structured in order to be executed. Elements wrapped in <> are required, elements wrapped in [] are optional.

`requiredPermissions`: *user* and *client* properties are arrays of key permissions flags that are needed run a command. In the case of *user*, the user needs any of the 
permissions to be authorized. In the case of *client*, the bot needs all of the permissions to run the command.

`run`: Function to execute when the command is invoked.

Needed for slash commands:

`slashCommand`: True or false, signifying if the object is a slash command. Should be true for obvious reasons.

`data`: Required information for slash commands. Refer to [this article](https://discordjs.guide/interactions/registering-slash-commands.html#options).


Optional properties:

`cooldown`: The cooldown of the command in milliseconds.

`selfPopulate`: A function that is run when the bot loads the command. Usually used to populate the aliases array, like the reaction command's, or create the data property for slash commands.

## Common issues
* **Slash commands not working**
Make sure the `application.commands` scope is authorized for your guild.
