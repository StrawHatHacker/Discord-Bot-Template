## üì• Installation
<b> Node.js v16.6.0 or higher required. </b> Download [here](https://nodejs.org/) <br/>
<b> MongoDB v4 or higher required. </b> Create [here](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/getting-started) for free.

###### 1. Clone this repository from your terminal:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/StrawHatHacker/Kiyo-Discord-Bot
```

###### 2. Navigate into the directory:
```shell
cd Kiyo-Discord-Bot/
```

###### 3. Install dependencies:
```shell
npm install
```

###### 4. Create .env file in the src directory:
```shell
cd src/
touch .env
```

###### 5. Add bot token into the .env file:
Open .env with your favourite text editor and add this line along with your bot token:

`DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN="Your bot token here"`

###### 6. Add MongoDB connection string into the .env file:
`DB_CONNECTION_STRING="Connection string here"`

###### 7. Add your Discord ID into the .env file:
`BOT_OWNER_ID="Discord ID here"`

###### 8. Add your development guild ID into the .env file:
`DEV_GUILD_ID="Discord ID here"`

###### 9. Add your bot's client ID into the .env file:
`BOT_ID="Discord ID here"`

###### 10. Add your environment into the .env file:
Can be either `DEV` or `PRODUCTION`. Use `PRODUCTION` to load slash commands for all guilds. Use `DEV` to load slash commands faster, only for your development server.
`ENVIRONMENT="Environment value here"`

###### 11. Run the bot (Assuming you are already in the /src directory):
```shell
node index.js 
```

## Creating a command
A command should be a file that exports an object. Properties of that object are:

```javascript
module.exports = {
    name: 'ban',
    description: 'Bans a user',
    aliases: ['boot'],
    syntax: 'ban <member> [reason]',
    requiredPermissions: {
        user: ['BAN_MEMBERS'],
        client: ['BAN_MEMBERS']
    },
    cooldown: 5000,
    async run() {
        // code here
    }
}
```

`name`: Is the name of the command. It gets matched to user input.

`description`: General information about the command.

`aliases`: Array of strings that can invoke the command. They get matched to user input.

`syntax`: Visual representation of how the command should be structured in order to be executed. Elements wrapped in <> are required, elements wrapped in [] are optional.

`requiredPermissions`: *user* and *client* properties are arrays of key permissions flags that are needed run a command. In the case of *user*, the user needs any of the 
permissions to be authorized. In the case of *client*, the bot needs all of the permissions to run the command.

`run`: Function to execute when the command is invoked.

Needed for slash commands:

###### Optional properties:

`cooldown`: The cooldown of the command in milliseconds.

`selfPopulate`: A function that is run when the bot loads the command (meaning on runtime and everytime you reload commands). Usually used to populate the aliases array, like the reaction command(see above), or create the data property for slash commands(see below).

## Creating a slash command
A command should be a file that exports an object. Properties of that object are:

```javascript
module.exports = {
   name: 'ping',
    description: 'Pings the bot',
    syntax: 'ping',
    aliases: [],
    requiredPermissions: {
        user: [],
        client: []
    },
    slashCommand: true,
    cooldown: 5000,
    selfPopulate() {
        this.data = new SlashCommandBuilder()
            .setName(this.name)
            .setDescription(this.description);
    }
}
```

`name`: Is the name of the slash command.

`description`: Short description of the slash command.

`aliases`: Array of strings that can invoke the slash command.

`syntax`: Visual representation of how the command should be structured in order to be executed. Elements wrapped in <> are required, elements wrapped in [] are optional.

`requiredPermissions`: *user* and *client* properties are arrays of key permissions flags that are needed run a command. In the case of *user*, the user needs any of the 
permissions to be authorized. In the case of *client*, the bot needs all of the permissions to run the command.

`run`: Function to execute when the command is invoked.

`slashCommand `: True or false, signifying if the object is a slash command. Should be true for obvious reasons.

`data`: Required information for slash commands. Refer to [this article](https://discordjs.guide/interactions/registering-slash-commands.html#options).

###### Optional properties:

`cooldown`: The cooldown of the command in milliseconds.

`selfPopulate`: A function that is run when the bot loads the command. Usually used to populate the aliases array, like the reaction command's, or create the data property for slash commands.

## Common issues
* **Slash commands not working**
Make sure the `application.commands` scope is checked when you invite the bot in your guild.
* **Logs sometimes display the wrong moderator**
Sadly audit logs don't work as we would like. This is the best implementation I could come up with.
Open an issue so we can see if it's important that needs fixing.
* **Reloading commands doesn't reflect my changes**
The slash command "reloadcommands" only reloads files in the `/src/commands`, `/src/slashCommands` and `/src/utils` folders.
* **Error: "The $changeStream stage is only supported on replica sets"**
Use [Atlas](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/getting-starte) or read [this article](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/convert-standalone-to-replica-set/).
